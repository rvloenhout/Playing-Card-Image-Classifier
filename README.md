# Playing Card Image Classifier
This project involved creating a playing card image classifier using PyTorch to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for card classification. The classes are defined by all the cards within a deck of playing cards, including the joker. The dataset used was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification/data), achieving an F1 score of 0.8313. However, there is room for improvement, as the top-rated model achieved an F1 score of 0.97.

To enhance accuracy, hyperparameter tuning can be performed, and transfer learning can be applied to boost performance. The model is accessible through Flask, allowing users to input images via a webpage and receive predictions based on the trained model.
